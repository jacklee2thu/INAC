# INAC (Integrated analysis toolkit for dissecting whole genome wide features of cell-free DNA)
## ABSTRACT
### Patterns in whole genome wide features of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in human plasma provide a noninvasive diagnostic approach for cancer detection. However, integrated analysis toolkit for whole genome wide features of cfDNA (INAC) is lacking. These cfDNA whole genome features including <span style :"backgroud color = pink"> fragment size, fragment size ratio, copy number variance, TSS relative coverage, Promoter fragmentation entropy </span> were estimated by a collected independent dataset (50 patients with gastric cancer and 50 healthy controls) with ~10x sequence depth. INAC also explores the relationships between these cfDNA features and other genomic or transcriptomic features including chromatin accessibility, gene expression levels and tumor derived programs, and reveals the aberrant patterns in patients with cancer. In conclusion, INAC has the potential to improve the diagnostic usage and have a deep understanding in cfDNA roles of liquid biopsy.
