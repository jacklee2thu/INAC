# INAC (Integrated analysis toolkit for dissecting whole genome wide features of cell-free DNA)
## *Jie Li & Xun Lan*

Patterns in whole genome wide features of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in human plasma provide a noninvasive diagnostic approach for cancer detection. Here, we provide integrated analysis toolkit for whole genome wide features of cfDNA (INAC) to explore **fragment size, fragment size ratio, copy number variance, TSS relative coverage, Promoter fragmentation entropy**. a collected independent dataset (50 patients with gastric cancer and 50 healthy controls) with ~10x sequence depth were estimated by INAC. INAC also explores the relationships between these cfDNA features and other genomic or transcriptomic features including chromatin accessibility, gene expression levels and tumor derived programs, and reveals the aberrant patterns in patients with cancer.
